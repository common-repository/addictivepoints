== Description ==

**addictive**points is an instant loyalty and rewards platform that provides a simple, flexible and effective loyalty solution for your business. Customers collect points from any of our partner sites and can then exchange them for 10,000 different products and services.

We have just launched a free starter package that will reward your customers for up to 3 actions including visiting your site daily, liking your brand page on facebook and following you on twitter.

As part of the package you will also receive access to a dashboard where you will be able to see who's been collecting points on your site, along with demographic and visitor related data. As a partner you will also be promoted within the partner pages on www.**addictive**points.com

Current partners include a huge range of businesses ranging from consumer driven events, content and transactional sites to many different business sectors from design agencies, magazines, cleaning companies, motorbike and baby food manufacturers, construction, financial services, events organisers, technology suppliers, holiday businesses and zoos.

Partners have already benefitted from the following results and increases:

o	Daily visits increase by more than +1100%

o	Facebook likes increase by +600%

o	Revenues increase by a whopping +46%
